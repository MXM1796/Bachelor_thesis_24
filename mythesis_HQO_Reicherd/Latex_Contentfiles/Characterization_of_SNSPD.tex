In the literature, four central characteristics for EPD have emerged to quantize the quality of detectors.
The detector efficiency, the dead count rate, the recovery time and the timing jitter.
In general there are more than those like after-pulsing or signal-to-noise ration however these four are the most comon ones.\\

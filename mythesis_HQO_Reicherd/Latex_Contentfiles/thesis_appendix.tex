\section{Neutral density filter calibration - Error calculation}\label{sec:ND_filter_calibration_appendix}

To calculate the OD value of the ND Filters, we have to consider the statistical error from the
transmission value and the systematic error, we get from measuring the OD with two methods, as explained in \ref{sec:experimental_setup}.

We first consider the statistical error from the transmission value.
The transmission is given by:

\begin{align}
    \text{T}=\frac{P_{\text{ND}}}{P}
\end{align}

Where $P$ is the power detected by the power metre without the ND filter and $P_{\text{ND}}$
is the power we measured with applied ND filter.

For the Error calculation the following considerations are done: 

First, for both $P$ and $P_{\text{ND}}$ the measurement uncertainty of the photodiode from the photodiode is always 3$\%$
of the measured value \cite{unknown-author-no-date}.
Since this uncertainty does not affect the overall relation between the two measurements it does not
contribute to the error calculation.
However, the measurement uncertainty from reading the value from the Powermeter contributes to both,
$P$ and $P_{\text{ND}}$, since reading the value from the powermeter provides always a different error because
the last displayed order of magnitude of the displayed result on the powermeter fluctuates.

Further, regarding  $\Delta P$ it is also important to mention that after each ND filter change,
the coupling was readjusted to the maximal vale.
However, after the ND filter was removed it was not possible to get to the same initial value.
Therefore, we always have different power values we compare, though the filtering process was done always with the same
fixed laser power setting.
Based on this, $P$ is the mean value of all initial values was taken and for the error the standard
deviation was calculated.
Due to this we have also to consider an $\textit{additional error source} $ $\Delta P^{\text{STD}}$ from the fiber
coupling and optimization in $\Delta P$ .

\textit{Important}: This only applies for the first measurement method because we adjust there our fiber coupling.
In the second measurement we have a stable $P$ because there, the fiber coupling was not adjusted, once the maximum was
reached.

So, $\Delta P$ for the first measurement method is calculated as follows:

\begin{align}
    \Delta P = \sqrt{(\Delta P_{\text{Read off}})^2 + (\Delta P_{\text{STD}})^2}
\end{align}

For $P_{\text{ND}}$ applies:

\begin{align}
    P_{\text{ND}} = P \cdot 10^{-OD}
\end{align}

The corresponding error is  $\Delta P = 0.03 \cdot P$ (uncertainty of the photodiode) and hence the total error for the power after the ND filter is calculated as follows:
\begin{align}
    \Leftarrow \Delta P_{\text{ND}} = \sqrt{(\Delta P \cdot 10^{-\text{OD}})^2 + (P \cdot \log(10) \cdot \Delta \text{OD})^2}
\end{align}.

An additional error from reading off the count rate (hence, the corresponding Power) from the computer screen was also considered,
since measurement with the power metre was not able.
However, because the fluctuating rate of the count rate was in the order of a few Hz, it was neglected for the final error calculation.

As result, we get the following error for the transmission rate:

\begin{align}
    \Delta T_{\text{stat}}= \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta P_{\text{ND}}}{P}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta P P_{\text{ND}}}{ P^2}\right)^2}
\end{align}.

Further for calculating the total transmission value and its error, we have to include the measurements and errors for the second method.
Here, we have stable power $P$ because the fiber coupling was not adjusted, once the maximum was reached.
The transmission error for the second method is also calculated the same way as above:

\begin{align}
    \Delta T= \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta P_{\text{ND}}}{P}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta P P_{\text{ND}}}{ P^2}\right)^2}
\end{align}.

but both values $\Delta P_{\text{ND}}$ and $\Delta P$ are estimated by the read off error of the powermeter.

%The values for this method are shown in table \ref{tab:}:
% Table has to be included!

With booth transmission values, the total transmission value and its total error (systematic and statistical) can be calculated as follows:

\begin{align}
    T_{\text{total}} = \frac{T_{\text{stat}} + T_{\text{systematic}}}{2}\\
    \Delta T_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{\Delta T_{\text{stat}}^2 + \Delta T_{\text{systematic}}^2}
\end{align}

Since, we do not know from which method the results are closer to the real OD value, we take the mean value of both values.

Continuing with the calculation of the OD value, we have according to \cite{Thorlabs-OD} the relation:
 $\text{OD}= \log(\frac{1}{T})$.
From this, we can calculate the error for the OD: $\Delta OD = \frac{\Delta T}{\ln(10) \cdot T}$

%# the final errors for the OD value are presented in table:
% Table has to be included!


Below are the tables with the calculated values and results for the first and second method, as well for the combined results
which lastly provide the final OD values used for the calculations:

This final values are in good agreement with the values from the manufacturer Thorlabs as shown on their website \cite{Thorlabs-OD}.
The self calculated errors even provide a narrower error range than the errors provided by Thorlabs.
Unfortunately, it can not be proved how close the calculated values are to the real OD values from Thorlabs, because no
exact values are given.
Only a rough curve (wavelength vs OD) is provided.
Here, exact determination of an expectation value can not be done.

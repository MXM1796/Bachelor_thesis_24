I would like to thank all members of the Nonlinear Quantum Optics group of the University of Bonn.
It was a pleasure to be part in this group and I learned a lot of new interesting physics.
Also, I want to thank the members from the HQO experiment, especially Julia Gamper, Leon Sadowski and Cedric Wind for the nice
atmosphere and support in my work.
Especially, at the final phase of my thesis.
I would also like to thank Prof. Sebastian Hofferberth for the opportunity to write my thesis and continue working in his group.
At the end I would like to thank my family and partner for the support and the patience during my studies.

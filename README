The idea with this document is that you also look at the LaTeX that
is used to create it, in order to find out how things are done.

The files that make up this document are available in a subversion
repository and as a tar file. To get the latest subversion
entries given the command:

svn co https://svn.physik.uni-bonn.de/basic/ubonn-thesis/trunk

If you want a particular release use the command:

svn co https://svn.physik.uni-bonn.de/basic/ubonn-thesis/tags/ubonn-thesis-N.M

The tar file also includes the guide as a PDF file: thesis_guide.pdf.
It can be obtained from:

http://www-biblio.physik.uni-bonn.de/info/index.shtml#info:titelvorl

You can then give the command:

make new [THESIS=dirname]

to create a new directory with a couple of files to help you get
started. By default the directory name will be mythesis.
If you choose a different name, you have to adjust the \include
commands inside ./dirname.tex.
To compile your thesis try:

make thesis [THESIS=dirname]

All packages that are needed should be part of your TeX
installation. If not you may have to install them or ask your system
administrator to do so.

My original idea was that the style file should work for all recent
TeX installations.  However, some of the packages I recommend have
been changing quite a lot over the past few years, particularly
biblatex and siunitx.  It may therefore be necessary to make a few
changes in order to get the thesis to compile on your machine. The
default version assumes that you have TeX Live 2011 or later.  If you
have TeX Live 2009, which implies that you have siunitx version 1 and
that you use bibtex8 with biblatex., you should set \texlive to 2009
in mythesis.tex. You should then use the command `make thesis09'
instead of `make thesis'.

If you just want to make the cover pages, use the file cover_only.tex.
Be sure to adapt the font selected in ubonn-thesis.sty to the font
you actually used in your thesis. Be aware that not all font sizes are
available in all font collections. If you used the default LaTeX font
in your thesis, then choose lmodern in the style file.

The main file for this guide is thesis_guide.tex and it
includes the LaTeX files in the directory ./guide and the
Feynman graphs in the directories ./feynmf and ./tikz.

You can create your own copy of the guide using the commands:

cd guide
make guide

The guide also includes a description of how to use the package under
Windows.

If you have TeX Live 2009 or earlier, you should set \texlive to 2009 in
thesis_guide.tex. In this case you need to compile the guide with the
commands `make feynmf; make guide09' instead of `make guide'.

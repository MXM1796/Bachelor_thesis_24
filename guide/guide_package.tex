\chapter{Useful packages}

%==============================================================================

\LaTeX{} file: \url{./guide_package.tex}\\[1ex]
\noindent
\LaTeX{} has so many packages that it is often hard to find the
correct or most useful ones. It is also not a good idea to just take
one of your friend's theses and use his/her packages and conventions,
as there is a steady and regular improvement in the packages
available.

This chapter will list some useful packages -- maybe also some that
are not so commonly known. Here I only say what the package is used
for. More detailed instructions on the usage can be found in the
relevant chapters.

From all that I have read, \KOMAScript\index{KOMAScript@\KOMAScript}
seems to be the way to go for the overall classes. I have therefore
based the \Package{ubonn-thesis} style on this. You replace
\Package{article}, \Package{report} and \Package{book} by
\Package{scrartcl}, \Package{scrreprt} and \Package{scrbook}. For
theses I think it is best to use \Package{scrbook}, as this class also
includes the commands \Macro{frontmatter}, \Macro{mainmatter} and
\Macro{backmatter} that set up page numbering etc.\ appropriately.

Please try to use \KOMAScript\ version 3.0 or higher. The
\Macro{KOMAoptions} command is not available in earlier versions, so
you would have to modify the style file.

\section{Layout and language}
\label{sec:package:layout}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are quite a few packages related to layout and also to handling
of text input and languages. As far as layout goes, \KOMAScript{} has
many options with which you can already do a lot. You can either use
the built-in \Package{typearea} package to do the page layout, which
also includes nice options to allow for the binding, or use the
\Package{geometry} package which also contains more than enough
options. In the past I have used \Package{geometry}, but I also see no
reason not to just use \Package{typearea}. Note that you should not
include the \Package{typearea} package, you should simply set the
options using \Macro{KOMAoptions}.
The packages are listed in Table~\ref{tab:package:layout}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lp{0.8\textwidth}}
    \Package{geometry} & Provides simple options for page layout such
    as \Option{scale=0.75} to cover 75\% of the page.\\
    \Package{typearea} & Does much the same, but here you specify how
    many elements to split the page into.\\
    \Package{setspace} & Useful options to change spacing.\\
    \Package{fontenc} & The encoding used for fonts. Recommended is
    \Option{T1}, which is given as an option.\\
    \Package{inputenc} & Use either \Option{utf8} or \Option{latin1} so
    that you can input German letters such as ä, ü and ß directly.\\
    \Package{babel} & Language specific typesetting.\\
    \Package{csquotes} & Package for quoting things using the correct
    language-dependent symbol.\\
    \Package{scrpage2} & Set headers and footer.\\
    \Package{xspace} & Avoid having to put
    \enquote{\texttt{\textbackslash\ }} or
    \enquote{\texttt{\{\}}} after a macro.
  \end{tabular}

\section{Appearance}
\label{sec:package:appearance}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It used to be the case that nearly all \LaTeX{} documents used the
Computer Modern Fonts. That is no longer necessary. There are rather
complete font sets that are also free that you can use instead. In
this guide I use the \Package{txfonts} package. Other fonts that look
quite nice (e.g.\ Palatino) can also be used. You have to use a
package such as \Package{pxfonts} to get both text and math fonts in
the same style. Some examples of other possible font packages are
given in the style file.

Commonly used packages associated with fonts, tables and
figures are listed in Table~\ref{tab:package:appearance}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lp{0.8\textwidth}}
    \Package{siunitx} & Typeset units properly with correct spacing.\\
    \Package{graphicx} & The package to use for including graphics.\\
    \Package{rotating} & Package to use for rotating tables etc. The
    \Macro{includegraphics} command can rotate figures directly.\\
    \Package{array} & Adds extra column formatting capabilities.\\
    \Package{longtable} & Can produce tables that extend over more
    than one page.\\
    \Package{booktabs} & Help for producing nicer tables.\\
    \Package{amsmath},\Package{amssym} & Extra math commands and symbols from
    AMS.\\
    \Package{mhchem} & Nice package for typesetting chemical elements
    correctly.\\
    \Package{xfrac} & Some more options for typesetting fractions.\\
    \Package{xcolor} & Add colour commands.\\
    \Package{titlesec} & Change the appearance of chapter and section
    headings.\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Useful packages for appearance.}
  \label{tab:package:appearance}
\end{table}

As an alternative to \Package{longtable}, one can also use
\Package{supertab}. Both packages also have the advantage that you
can specify header and footer text.

\section{Other packages}
\label{sec:package:other}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some other useful packages are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:package:other1}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lp{0.8\textwidth}}
    \Package{ifthen} & Provides the \Macro{ifthenelse} command.\\
    \Package{IEEEtrantools} & Contains useful environments for multiline equations.\\
    \Package{feynmf} & Drawing Feynman graphs with Metafont\\
    \Package{feynmp} & Drawing Feynman graphs with Metapost.\\
    \Package{axodraw} & Drawing Feynman graphs.\\
    \Package{tikz} & General drawing package that can also be used for
    Feynman graphs.\\
    \Package{standalone} & Allows you to have a document that you can
    directly compile for each figure and also input to another document.\\
    \Package{hyperref} & Adds \Macro{url} command as well as ability
    to click on entries on table of contents etc.\\
    \Package{subfiles} & Provides a nice alternative to
    \Macro{include}.\\
    \Package{subfig} & As the name suggests make sub-figures and add
    separate captions for them. \emph{This package has apparently been
      deprecated.}\\
    \Package{subcaption} & An alternative to \Package{subfig}.\\
    \Package{tabularx} & Allows fixed table width with flexible column
    widths.\\
    \Package{floatrow} & Add ability to define own floats.\\
    \Package{adjustbox} & Add much more sophisticated clipping
    capabilities than offered by \Package{graphicx}.\\
    \Package{caption} & Much more control on captions -- as
    \KOMAScript{} also has many options, not sure this is necessary.\\
    \Package{wrapfig} & Allow text to flow around figures.\\
    \Package{floatflt} & Similar capabilities to \Package{wrapfig} -- allow text to flow around figures.\\
    \Package{glossaries} & Provide commands for creating a
    glossary. This is intended to replace the \Package{glossary}
    package.\\
    \Package{nomencl} & Another package for creating a glossary.\\
    \Package{fncychap} & Another package for changing the style of the
    chapter heading.\\
    \Package{quotchap} & Another package for changing the style of the
    chapter heading.\\
    \Package{refcheck} & Check whether labels are used, i.e.\ if figures
    and tables are actually referenced.\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Other useful packages.}
  \label{tab:package:other1}
\end{table}

While the \Package{amsmath} package solves many problems that occur if
you just use the normal \LaTeX{} math mode commands, there are some
things that are not so nice with long and complicated multiline
equations. \Package{IEEEtrantools}, in particular the
\Env{IEEEeqnarray} environment, can help here. See Ref.~\cite{lshort}
or the package documentation for more details.

\Package{standalone} is both a package and a document class. It is
available from \TeXLive 2012 onward. It allows you to have a
standalone document for a \Package{tikz} or \Package{feynmf} figure
and also input this file into another document. If you run PDF\LaTeX\
on the file it also automatically crops the resulting picture. This is
one of those packages where you think \enquote{Why didn't someone
  create this years ago?}. The \Package{tikz} figures included in this
guide make use of it.

I do not recommend the \Package{subfiles} package by default as it is not
included in \TeXLive by default. Have a look at
\url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/General_Guidelines} for
example for more information. If you want to use the package you have
to download it and install for yourself. You can do much the same
thing using AUCTeX inside \texttt{emacs}.

A list of other packages that are commonly used is given in
Table~\ref{tab:package:other2}. They are not
included in the list above, because they are either not really needed
or have been superseded by other packages.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lp{0.8\textwidth}}
    \Package{hepunits} & Typeset units properly with correct spacing\\
    \Package{units} & Typeset units properly with correct spacing.\\
    \Package{SIunits} & Typeset units properly with correct
    spacing. \Package{hepunits} uses this package, so it does not need
    to be added explicitly\\
    \Package{fancyhdr} & As the name suggests, do your own header and
    footer configuration. Within \KOMAScript{} it is recommended to use
    \Package{scrpage2} instead\\
    \Package{dcolumn} & Very helpful for lining up columns on character
    strings such as a decimal point. \Package{siunitx} offers similar
    and better functionality.\\
    \Package{color} & Add colour commands -- \Package{xcolor} is
    needed to colour boxes around links.\\
    \Package{float} & As far as I can tell \Package{floatflt} offers more options.\\
    \Package{ziffer} & Spacing with a comma as decimal separator is
    correct.
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Other packages that are often used, but I have already
    given alternatives.}
  \label{tab:package:other2}
\end{table}

As indicated, the \Package{ziffer} package is advertised as providing
the correct spacing after a comma in math mode if you use the comma as
the decimal separator. Compare $2,5$ with 2,5 and $2{,}5$. The first
spacing is wrong. If you use the \Package{ziffer} package it will be
correct. However, it does seem to conflict with the use of the
\Package{dcolumn} package, so I cannot compile this guide
if \Package{ziffer} is included. Some  workarounds are discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:layout:german}. In addition, the \Package{siunitx}
package contains the same functionality, which can simply be steered
by changing the document language, as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:table:siunitx}. Hence, \Package{ziffer} is not really
needed anymore.
